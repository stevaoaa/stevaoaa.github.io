### About
I work at the intersection of Software Engineering and Software Testing. My work draws on automate software testing activity, empirical research, mutation testing, and metamorphic testing to solve software engineering quality problems, such as fault detection, software testing oracle problem and software testing/engineering education. I'm currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.usp.br) (USP), working on software testing for virtual reality applications. I received a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www.usp.br) (USP), and a B.Sc. in Information Systems from [Faculdade Integral Diferencial](https://www.wyden.com.br/unifacid) (FACID).
