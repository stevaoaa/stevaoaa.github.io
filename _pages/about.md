I was born in 1987 in Brazil and spent my childhood in Teresina, the capital of Piauí state.

I studied Information Systems at Faculdade Integral Diferencial. During my studies, I dove into internships as a Java backend developer.

After working for about 2 years, I decided to take a break and return to academia to pursue a master's degree.

In 2013, I moved to São Carlos, a city 200 km away from São Paulo, and started my master's on a software engineering topic related to software testing. During my master's, I mostly worked with parallel algorithms to reduce the effort of a software testing technique called mutation testing.

In 2016, I began my Ph.D., also in the software testing area. This time, I focused on developing techniques to automate testing strategies for virtual reality applications. I worked with a software testing technique called metamorphic testing and used reinforcement learning to generate automatic testing data.

I still work as an academic, performing reviews for scientific conferences and journals in the software engineering area. Additionally, I work as a Test Engineer, providing software testing solutions for a variety of projects, including frontend, backend, and mobile.

Outside of software, I enjoy gaming, biking, and traveling.
